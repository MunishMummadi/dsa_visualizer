# DSA Visualizer

A Data Structures and Algorithms Visualizer built with Rust and egui.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an interactive and educational tool for visualizing various data structures and algorithms. Users will be able to select different data structures, apply algorithms, and see the operations animated in real-time.

## Current State

- Basic UI setup with egui
- Array data structure implemented
- Bubble Sort algorithm visualization (basic implementation)

## End Goals

1. Support multiple data structures:
   - Array
   - Linked List
   - Binary Tree
   - Graph

2. Implement various algorithms:
   - Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
   - Search algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
   - Tree traversals (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
   - Graph algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*)

3. Features:
   - Interactive UI for selecting data structures and algorithms
   - Step-by-step visualization of algorithm execution
   - Ability to pause, resume, and reset visualizations
   - Customizable input for data structures
   - Performance metrics (time complexity, space complexity)
   - Educational explanations for each algorithm
